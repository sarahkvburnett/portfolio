# Portfolio

> Thought I would make myself a portfolio to demonstrate progress so far... <br> Using express and pug templating to pull in project info from MongoDB as felt more appropriate than react for this. Usting stylus a go for styling so two lots of indentation.

- Intro card
- About section
- Projects with individual project cards

## To do
